# Numpy

NumPy is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Here are some important notes about NumPy:

- To use the mathematical constant pi from the math module, you can import it as `math.pi`.
- Alternatively, you can import only pi from the math module as `from math import pi`.
- NumPy arrays contain a single datatype and are similar to lists.
- You can import NumPy as `import numpy as np`.
- The shape attribute of a NumPy array describes its dimensions.
- For a 2D array, you can access elements using the syntax `[row_index, column_index]`.
- NumPy provides various functions like `np.mean(x)`, `np.median(x)`, `np.std(x)`, and `np.corrcoef(x1, x2)` for calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient, respectively.
- The code snippet demonstrates filtering an array based on a condition.

Here's a modified version of the code snippet with a more reasonable and precise code, along with the expected output:

```python
import numpy as np

areas = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])  # Assuming areas are given as numerical values
filter_val = [True, False, True, False, True]
filtered_areas = areas[filter_val]

print(filtered_areas)

```

Output:

```
[10 30 50]

```

This code snippet creates a NumPy array called `areas` with values representing different areas. It then defines a boolean filter using the `filter_val` list. By applying this filter to the `areas` array using indexing (`areas[filter_val]`), only the elements that correspond to `True` in the filter are selected. Finally, the filtered areas are printed as the output.
