# Python Basics and Fundamentals

## Introduction

Python is a versatile programming language known for its adaptability and broad range of applications.

## Arithmetic Operations

In Python, you can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.

```python
print(7 + 10)
```

## **Applications of Python**

Python can be used for various purposes:

1. Performing quick calculations.
2. Developing database-driven websites for new businesses.
3. Analyzing and cleaning data from surveys or other sources.

## **Understanding Versatility**

The term "versatile" refers to Python's ability to adapt to different tasks and environments.

## **Operators in Python**

Python supports various operators for arithmetic operations, represented by symbols. These operators include:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulo (%)
- Exponentiation (**)

## **Variables and Data Types**

In Python, variables are case-sensitive and can hold different data types. To determine the data type of a variable, you can use the **`type()`** function.

```python
str_var = 'this is a string'
bool_var = False
```

For example, you can use the `type()` function to determine the data type of a variable:

```python
pythonCopy code
str_var = 'Hello'
num_var = 42
bool_var = True

print(type(str_var))   # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(num_var))   # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(bool_var))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

```

In this case, the `type()` function will return the respective data types of the variables `str_var`, `num_var`, and `bool_var`.

## **String Concatenation**

In Python, you can concatenate strings using the **`+`** operator.

```python
'ab' + 'cd'
```

## Here are examples of using conversion functions in Python:

- Converting a string to an integer using `int()`:

```python
str_num = "10"
int_num = int(str_num)
print(int_num)   # Output: 10
```

- Converting a float to an integer using `int()`:

```python
float_num = 3.14
int_num = int(float_num)
print(int_num)   # Output: 3
```

- Converting an integer to a float using `float()`:

```python
int_num = 5
float_num = float(int_num)
print(float_num)   # Output: 5.0
```

- Converting a boolean value to a string using `str()`:

```python
bool_val = True
str_val = str(bool_val)
print(str_val)   # Output: 'True'
```

- Converting a string to a boolean value using `bool()`:

```python
str_val = "False"
bool_val = bool(str_val)
print(bool_val)   # Output: True
```

## **Lists and Slicing**

Lists are ordered collections in Python. You can slice lists using the syntax **`list[start:end]`**.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced_list = my_list[1:4]
```

## Global Variable and Variable Scope

In Python, a global variable is a variable that is defined outside of any function and can be accessed by all parts of the program. The variable scope refers to the part of the program where a variable can be accessed.

For example:

Here is an example of using the `global` keyword in Python:

```python
global_var = 10

def my_function():
    global global_var
    local_var = 5
    print(global_var)   # Output: 10
    print(local_var)    # Output: 5
    global_var = 20     # Modifying the global variable

my_function()
print(global_var)       # Output: 20 (updated value)

```

In this example, the `global` keyword is used to indicate that the `global_var` variable inside the function should refer to the global variable with the same name. Without using the `global` keyword, the `global_var` inside the function would create a new local variable instead of modifying the global variable.

## Data Types

In Python, there are various data types that serve different purposes:

### Text

The text data type, often referred to as a string, is used to represent sequences of characters.
For example: `name = "John"`

### Numeric

Numeric data types include integers, floats, and complex numbers. Integers represent whole numbers, floats represent decimal numbers, and complex numbers represent numbers with real and imaginary parts.
For example:

- `age = 25`
- `height = 1.75`
- `complex_num = 2 + 3j`

### Boolean

The boolean data type represents either `True` or `False`. It is commonly used in decision-making and control structures.
For example: `is_student = True`

### Sequence

Sequence data types include lists, tuples, and ranges. Lists are ordered collections that can contain elements of different data types. Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created. Ranges are used to represent a sequence of numbers.
For example:

- `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
- `my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)`
- `my_range = range(0, 10)`

### Map

The map data type refers to dictionaries, which are collections of key-value pairs. Each value is associated with a unique key.
For example: `student = {"name": "John", "age": 25}`

### Set

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are commonly used for mathematical operations such as union, intersection, and difference.
For example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`

### Binary

Binary data types include bytes, bytearrays, and memory views. They are used to represent binary data and perform operations on it.
For example:

- `my_bytes = b"Hello"`
- `my_bytearray = bytearray(b"World")`
- `my_memoryview = memoryview(b"Python")`

### NoneType

The NoneType data type represents the absence of a value. It is often used to indicate the absence of a variable.
For example: `result = None`

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## In Python, functions can be created using the `def` keyword. Functions allow you to group a set of instructions together and execute them whenever needed. Here's an example of defining a function in Python:

```python
def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greeting("John")   # Output: Hello, John!

```

In this example, the `greeting()` function takes a parameter `name` and prints a greeting message with the provided name.

Python also provides built-in methods for manipulating strings and lists. These methods are pre-defined functions that can be called on objects of specific data types. For example, you can use the `upper()` method to convert a string to uppercase:

```python
my_string = "hello world"
print(my_string.upper())   # Output: HELLO WORLD
```

Similarly, you can use methods like `sort()` to sort a list:

```python
my_list = [3, 1, 2]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)   # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

These built-in methods make it easier to perform common operations on strings, lists, and other data types in Python.
