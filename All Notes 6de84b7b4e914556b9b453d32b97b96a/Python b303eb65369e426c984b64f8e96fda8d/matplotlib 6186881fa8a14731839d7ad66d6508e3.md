# matplotlib

Matplotlib is a powerful library in Python used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plotting options and is widely used in various fields, including data analysis, scientific research, and machine learning.

In this document, you will find examples of different types of plots that can be created using Matplotlib. These examples include empty plots, line plots, scatter plots with logarithmic scaling, histograms, and scatter plots with varying point sizes and colors.

Let's dive into the examples to explore the capabilities of Matplotlib!

1. **Empty Plot**
    
    ```python
    # Import the matplotlib library for plotting
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Create an empty plot
    plt.plot()  # This creates an empty plot without any data
    
    # Show the plot
    plt.show()  # This displays the plot on the screen
    
    ```
    
    Output Note: The code above doesn't produce any visible output because it only creates an empty plot without any data.
    
2. **Line Plot**
    
    ```python
    # Import the required libraries
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Make a line plot with given data: year on the x-axis, pop on the y-axis
    plt.plot(year, pop)  # This creates a line plot using the data in the 'year' and 'pop' variables
    
    # Display the plot
    plt.show()  # This displays the line plot with 'year' on the x-axis and 'pop' on the y-axis
    
    ```
    
    Output Note: This code will display a line plot showing the population over the years.
    
3. **Scatter Plot with Logarithmic Scaling**
    
    ```python
    # Import the required libraries
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Create a scatter plot with logarithmic scaling on the x-axis
    plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)  # This creates a scatter plot with 'gdp_cap' on the x-axis and 'life_exp' on the y-axis
    plt.xscale('log')  # This scales the x-axis logarithmically
    plt.show()  # This displays the scatter plot
    
    ```
    
    Output Note: This code will display a scatter plot with GDP per capita on a logarithmic scale on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis.
    
4. **Histogram**
    
    ```python
    # Import the required libraries
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Create a histogram
    plt.hist(list, bins=10)  # This creates a histogram with data from the 'list' variable and 10 bins
    plt.clf()  # This clears the current figure
    plt.xlabel()  # Set the label for the x-axis
    plt.ylabel()  # Set the label for the y-axis
    plt.title()  # Set the title of the plot
    plt.xticks()  # Set the ticks on the x-axis
    plt.yticks()  # Set the ticks on the y-axis
    plt.show()  # This displays the histogram
    
    ```
    
    Output Note: This code will display a histogram with 10 bins using the data from the 'list' variable.
    
5. **Scatter Plot with Varying Point Sizes and Colors**
    
    ```python
    # Import the required libraries
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    # Create a scatter plot with varying point sizes and colors
    plt.scatter(x=gdp_cap, y=life_exp, s=np.array(pop) * 2, c=col, alpha=0.8)  # This creates a scatter plot with GDP per capita on the x-axis, life expectancy on the y-axis, varying point sizes based on population, and colors based on 'col'
    plt.grid(True)  # This adds a grid to the plot
    plt.show()  # This displays the scatter plot
    
    ```
    
    Output Note: This code will display a scatter plot with GDP per capita on the x-axis, life expectancy on the y-axis, where the size of the points corresponds to the population, and the color of the points varies. Additionally, it adds a grid to the plot.
