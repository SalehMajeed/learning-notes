# Creating a POD

### Creating a Pod using YAML Configuration

To create a pod in Kubernetes, you define its configuration in a YAML file. The following example illustrates a simple pod configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: post
spec:
  containers:
    - name: posts
      image: stephengrider/posts:0.0.1
```

In this YAML configuration:

- **`apiVersion: v1`** specifies the Kubernetes API version used for this resource.
- **`kind: Pod`** indicates that we are defining a Pod resource.
- **`metadata`** contains information about the pod, such as its name.
- **`spec`** defines the desired state of the pod, including its containers.
- **`containers`** is an array specifying the containers within the pod. In this case, there is one container named "posts."
- **`name: posts`** assigns the name "posts" to the container.
- **`image: stephengrider/posts:0.0.1`** specifies the Docker image to use for the container. In this example, it pulls the image "stephengrider/posts" with version "0.0.1."

To create the pod, save this configuration in a file (e.g., **`mypod.yaml`**) and apply it using the **`kubectl apply -f`** command:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml
```

This will instantiate a pod named "post" with a container named "posts" using the specified Docker image.
