# Docker Intro

# **Understanding Docker**

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers provide a lightweight and consistent environment, allowing applications to run seamlessly across different environments.

## **Docker Architecture**

Docker follows a client-server architecture:

- **Docker Client:** This is the command-line tool that allows users to interact with Docker.
- **Docker Server (Daemon):** The Docker daemon runs on a host machine, managing Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.

The communication between the client and the server is facilitated through the Docker API.

## **Docker Image Lifecycle**

The process of working with Docker images involves the following steps:

1. **Check Image Cache:** Docker checks if the required image is already present in the local cache.
2. **Download Image:** If the image is not in the cache, Docker downloads it from the Docker Hub or another registry.
3. **Image Cache:** Once downloaded, the image is stored in the local cache for future use.

## **Container Isolation and Namespacing**

Docker uses namespacing to isolate resources for processes or groups of processes. This isolation ensures that containers do not interfere with each other and that each container has its own isolated environment.

## **Common Docker Commands**

Here are some essential Docker commands along with explanations and examples:

1. **`docker run image-name`**: Runs a container based on the specified image. Example: `docker run busybox echo hi there`.
2. **`docker ps`**: Lists the running containers.
3. **`docker system prune`**: Cleans up unused containers, networks, and images to free up space.
4. **`docker create image-name`**: Creates a new container based on the specified image but does not start it.
5. **`docker logs container-id`**: Displays the logs of a specific container. Example: `docker logs abc123`.
6. **`docker stop container-id`**: Stops a running container gracefully using the SIGTERM signal. Example: `docker stop abc123`.
7. **`docker kill container-id`**: Forcefully terminates a running container using the SIGKILL signal. Example: `docker kill abc123`.
8. **`docker exec -it container-id command`**: Executes a command inside a running container. Example: `docker exec -it abc123 /bin/bash`.
9. **`docker run -it container-name bash`**: Runs a container interactively with a Bash shell. Example: `docker run -it ubuntu bash`.

These commands are fundamental for working with Docker containers and managing Dockerized applications efficiently.
