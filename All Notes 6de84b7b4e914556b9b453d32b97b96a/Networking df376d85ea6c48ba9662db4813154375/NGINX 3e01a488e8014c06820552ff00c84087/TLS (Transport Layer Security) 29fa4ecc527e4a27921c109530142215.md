# TLS (Transport Layer Security)

TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communication over a computer network. It ensures privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. Here are key aspects of TLS:

- **Establishing end-to-end encryption:** TLS is primarily employed to encrypt the data exchanged between a client and a server, ensuring that it remains confidential and secure during transit. This encryption occurs at the transport layer, protecting the data as it travels across the network.
- **Utilizing symmetric encryption:** Symmetric encryption is a key aspect of TLS. In a TLS-encrypted communication, both the client and server share a secret key. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data, providing a secure means of communication. Symmetric encryption is efficient for bulk data encryption.

**Example:**
Imagine a user accessing a secure website (e.g., an online banking site). When the user enters sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details, TLS ensures that this information is encrypted before being transmitted over the internet. The website and the user's device share a secret key that allows them to encrypt and decrypt the data securely.

- **TLS termination cases:**
    - **TLS passthrough:** In TLS passthrough, the encrypted traffic is not decrypted by an intermediary (like a load balancer or proxy) but is passed directly to the destination server. This is commonly used when the server needs to handle the decryption process, and the intermediary only manages the routing of encrypted traffic without inspecting its content.

**Example:**
Consider an organization using a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic to multiple servers. With TLS passthrough, the load balancer forwards the encrypted traffic directly to the backend servers without decrypting it. The servers themselves handle the decryption process, ensuring end-to-end security.

In summary, TLS plays a crucial role in securing communication by providing encryption at the transport layer. Understanding the termination cases, such as TLS passthrough, helps in configuring systems for optimal security based on specific use cases and requirements.
