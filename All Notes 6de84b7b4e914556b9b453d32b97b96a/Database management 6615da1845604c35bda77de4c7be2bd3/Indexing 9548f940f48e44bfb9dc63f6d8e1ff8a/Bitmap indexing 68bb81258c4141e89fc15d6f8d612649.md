# Bitmap indexing

A bitmap index is a specialized type of index used in database systems to efficiently handle columns with a small number of distinct values, often referred to as low-cardinality columns. Instead of using a traditional index structure, such as B-trees used in regular indexes, a bitmap index uses a bitmap data structure to represent the existence or absence of each value in the indexed column.

In a bitmap index, a bitmap is created for each distinct value in the column being indexed. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a row in the table, and the bit is set to 1 if the value is present in that row and 0 if it is absent. The bitmaps are compact and space-efficient, making them suitable for columns with low cardinality.

**Example:**

Let's consider an example of a "Gender" column in an employee table that has two distinct values: "Male" and "Female." The bitmap index for this column would have two bitmaps, one for "Male" and another for "Female." Each bitmap would have one bit per row, indicating whether the employee in that row is male or female.

```yaml
yamlCopy code
Gender: [ Male ]  [ Female ]
        1         0          (Row 1: Male)
        0         1          (Row 2: Female)
        1         0          (Row 3: Male)
        1         0          (Row 4: Male)
        0         1          (Row 5: Female)

```

**Bitmap Index Scan vs. Index Scan:**

Both bitmap index scan and index scan are types of index access methods used to retrieve data from the database. However, they differ in their mechanisms and scenarios where they are efficient.

1. **Bitmap Index Scan:**
    - A bitmap index scan is used when multiple low-cardinality conditions are combined using logical operators (AND, OR) in the WHERE clause of a query.
    - The database performs a bitmap merge operation to combine the bitmaps of multiple conditions, resulting in a final bitmap that represents the rows satisfying the combined conditions.
    - The final bitmap is then used to fetch the actual rows from the table efficiently.
    - Bitmap index scan is beneficial when selecting data based on multiple low-cardinality columns simultaneously.
2. **Index Scan:**
    - An index scan is used when querying based on high-cardinality columns (columns with many distinct values).
    - The database directly follows the index tree structure, looking up the specific rows that match the search condition.
    - Index scans are efficient for columns with high cardinality because they can quickly narrow down the search space.
    - Index scan is more suitable when selecting data based on a single or a few high-cardinality columns.

**Summary:**

Bitmap indexes are advantageous for low-cardinality columns, as they efficiently handle multiple conditions involving such columns. They use bitmaps to represent presence or absence of values, making them space-efficient for such scenarios. On the other hand, regular index scans are more suitable for high-cardinality columns, as they can quickly pinpoint the specific rows based on the index tree structure. The choice between bitmap index scan and index scan depends on the cardinality of the column and the complexity of the query conditions involving the column.
