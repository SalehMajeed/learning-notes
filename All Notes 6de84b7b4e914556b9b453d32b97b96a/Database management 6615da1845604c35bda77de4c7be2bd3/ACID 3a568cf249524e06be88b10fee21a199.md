# ACID

Transaction has 4 Properties know as **ACIDâ†’**

ACID refers to the four essential properties of a transaction:

1. **Atomicity:** All queries in a transaction must be completed, or none of them must be completed. If any operation fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain data integrity.
    
    **Example:** Consider a bank transaction where you transfer money from one account to another. The transaction involves deducting money from one account and crediting it to another. If the transfer fails after deducting money from the first account but before crediting it to the second account, the entire transaction should be rolled back to keep the data consistent.
    
2. **Consistency:** This property ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction is completed. In other words, the database should be consistent at all times, regardless of any transactional changes.
    
    **Example:** Suppose you have a database table that stores the ages of users, and the ages must be greater than 18. If a transaction attempts to update a user's age to 15, the consistency property ensures that the database will reject the change as it violates the age constraint.
    
3. **Isolation:** Isolation deals with how multiple transactions work under consistency without interfering with each other. For example, if one transaction is updating a table simultaneously while another transaction is ongoing, the ongoing transaction must not be affected by the updated values. The data seen by the ongoing transaction should reflect the state of the table at the beginning of the transaction.
    
    **Example:** Consider two transactions trying to withdraw money from the same bank account simultaneously. Isolation ensures that both transactions see the account balance as it was before any withdrawals, preventing one transaction from affecting the other's view of the balance.
    
4. **Durability:** Durability refers to the persistence of data after the transaction is successfully committed. Once a transaction is committed, its changes should be permanent and stored safely in memory.
    
    **Example:** After successfully transferring money between accounts in a bank transaction and committing the changes, the new account balances must persist even if the system crashes or experiences power loss. The durability property ensures that the changes made during the transaction are safely stored in the database.
