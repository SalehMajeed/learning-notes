# Bloom filter

A simple Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to quickly test whether an element is "possibly in a set" or "definitely not in a set" with a small probability of false positives. It uses multiple hash functions and a bit array to perform fast membership tests.

Imagine we have a Bloom filter with the following properties:

- Bit array size: 8 bits (represented as an array of 8 binary digits)
- Number of hash functions: 2
1. Initialization:
    - The Bloom filter is initially created with all bits set to 0:
        
        ```scss
        scssCopy code
        00000000 (8 bits)
        
        ```
        
2. Liking a Post:
    - When a user likes a post, we apply the two hash functions ('h1' and 'h2') to the post ID, and the corresponding bits in the bit array are set to 1:
    
    ```sql
    sqlCopy code
    Post ID: 123
    h1(123) = 2 (Set bit 2)
    h2(123) = 5 (Set bit 5)
    
    Bit array after liking:
    00100100 (8 bits)
    
    ```
    
3. Checking If a Post Is Liked:
    - To check if the user has liked a post with ID 123, we apply the same two hash functions ('h1' and 'h2') to the post ID:
    
    ```sql
    sqlCopy code
    Post ID: 123
    h1(123) = 2 (Bit at index 2 is set)
    h2(123) = 5 (Bit at index 5 is set)
    
    Result: The Bloom filter indicates that the user might have liked the post (with some probability of false positives).
    
    ```
    
4. Checking If a Different Post Is Liked:
    - Let's check if the user has liked a post with ID 456:
    
    ```python
    pythonCopy code
    Post ID: 456
    h1(456) = 6 (Bit at index 6 is not set)
    h2(456) = 2 (Bit at index 2 is set)
    
    Result: The Bloom filter correctly indicates that the user has not liked the post.
    
    ```
    

Please note that Bloom filters can produce false positives, which means the filter might indicate that a user has liked a post even if they haven't. However, they guarantee no false negatives; if the filter says the user has not liked a post, they indeed have not liked it. Bloom filters are particularly useful when memory space is limited and occasional false positives are acceptable.
